# SEND_RECEIVE_UDP
It is a C++ application that can be used to do automatic test. First run the software to be tested for reading values 1 => ON, 0 => OFF for some buttons, then modify their values locally and automatically (or manually) through this application send.exe! Obviously, the ports for sending packages must be configured based on your needs.
