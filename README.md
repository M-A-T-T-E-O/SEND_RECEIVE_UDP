# SEND_RECEIVE_UDP
It is a C++ application that can be used to do automatic tests. First run your code X to be tested and read values 1 => ON, 0 => OFF for some buttons depending on your machine, then modify their values locally both automatically or manually through send.exe! Obviously, the ports for sending packages must to be configured based on your needs; by default are made two send for ports 3001 and 4001. The receive.exe is useful to test first the UDP communication; it must be implemented directly inside the code you need to test
